## Final Project
### Porcelain Crab Project Data Analysis
__Summary__
	My master's thesis work is focused on a non-native climate migrant species, the green porcelain crab (*Petrolisthes armatus*). These crabs, originally native to the Caribbean, have expanded their range into temperate regions of the western Atlantic as ocean and sea surface temperatures rise. Their known range now stretches from the southern tip of Brazil to southern Florida (native range) into central Florida (crytogenic range) and northwards from northern Florida through the mid-coast of North Carolina (non-native range). 

	I will be investigating the following: 
		- Various population demographics including abundance, sex-ratios, and body-size metrics
		- Infection prevalence of *Aporobopyrus curtatus* from host populations along the non-native range
		- Reproductive performance between populations measured as the brood dry mass/female dry mass as well as body-size at onset of reproduction

	The following functions in R will be used to create visualizations of the data mentioned above:
		- geospatial mapping
		- ggplot (bar plot, scatterplot, histogram, etc.)
		- generalized linear model
